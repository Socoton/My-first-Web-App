    <div><p class="am-p"> Hello, I'm Solen, based in Troyes (France). I'm a dynamic and creative web developer with a passion for programming. I'm a career changer who has developed solid expertise in R&D and data (through internships focused on data modeling and datas management). I bring this analytical rigor to my web projects. My preferred language remains Python 3. At the same time, I cultivate my creativity and critical thinking through a passion for art (I take painting classes at the Beaux-Arts) and philosophy, assets that fuel my innovative approach to development.</p></div>
